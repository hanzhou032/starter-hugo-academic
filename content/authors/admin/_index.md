I am a third-year PhD student in *Computation, Cognition, and Language* (NLP) at [Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am supervised by [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/) and [Dr. Ivan VuliÄ‡](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/). I am also a Student Researcher at [Google Cloud AI Research](https://research.google/) and [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/). Previously, I interned at the [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction) [Responsible AI](https://research.google/teams/responsible-ai/) Team at [Google Research](https://research.google/).

I am always interested in modular, efficient, and reward-driven intelligence.
